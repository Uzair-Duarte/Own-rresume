    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        At 16 years old, I have successfully completed my matriculation and am currently pursuing my Intermediate in
        Computer Science (ICs). Alongside my formal education, I have also dedicated time to enhancing my skills in web
        development. I have completed several web development courses and gained six months of hands-on experience in
        the field. This combination of academic and practical learning has equipped me with a solid foundation in both
        theoretical knowledge and practical application, preparing me for future opportunities in the tech industry.

        <li>
            <h3>WordPress Development</h3>
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits and web development training, I have practical experience in creating websites, particularly in the niche of house renting. Using WordPress, I have successfully built and managed several websites tailored to facilitate the rental process. These websites are designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional, providing a seamless experience for both property owners and potential renters. This hands-on project experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in project management and client satisfaction.</p>
